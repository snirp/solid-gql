# solid-gql
Educational project to create a todo and chat app using SolidJS, NodeJS and GraphQL, 
loosely based on this video: [Solid + GraphQL = Realtime Magic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZc2hSghezM) by Jack Herirngton.

It uses SolidJS and NodeJS to build and implement a graphQL API with mutations and subscriptions.
